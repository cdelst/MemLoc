1. Backend location ingestion api funtionality

    Equivilence classes:

    1. Location has not been sent from the app yet
    2. Location has been sent, but is malformed
    3. Location has been sent, but did not save properly
    4. Location has been sent, and did save properly

    Test Cases:

    1. Correctly formed location data that HAS been sent can be parsed and stored
        a. Correctly stored data can be retrieved afterwards
    2. No data has been sent to backend yet, so calling the endpoint returns "not found" with a 404
